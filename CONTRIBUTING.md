# How To Contribute

- There are no contribution policies except for a single "pottery barn rule". Relax and have fun!
- Create GitHub [issues](https://github.com/Floofies/NovaSector/issues) when you encounter bugs or have questions.
- Create GitHub [pull requests](https://github.com/Floofies/NovaSector/pulls) to fix bugs or add new features.
- Attempt to help a first-time contributor to create and merge a pull request.

## Pottery Barn Rule

["You break it, you buy it."](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pottery_Barn_rule)

You will be held responsible for ensuring that your new contributions are fully tested and bug-fixed prior to you moving on from them.

If you frequently fail to follow the pottery barn rule, such as by the leaving your contributions in a "broken" or "buggy" state, then your future contributions may be delayed.
