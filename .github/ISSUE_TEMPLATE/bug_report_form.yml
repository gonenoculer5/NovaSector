        ## If you use the "Report Issue" button in the top-right corner of the game, it will automatically fill in some of the information below.

        If you are reporting an issue found in another branch or codebase, you _must_ link the branch or codebase repo in your issue report or it will be closed.
        For branches, If you have not pushed your code up, please either reproduce it on master or push your code up before making an issue report.
        For other codebases, if you do not have a public code repository you will be refused help unless you can completely reproduce the issue on our master branch.
